It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why, but you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact, and if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit

It's just one of those days, feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac, you better watch your back
'Cause I'm fuckin' up your program!
And if you're stuck up, you're just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!
It's just one of those days
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit
Punk, so come and get it

I feel like shit
My suggestion is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
We've all felt like shit and been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers that want to step up
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break somethin' tonight
I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps goin' this way
I just might break your fuckin' face tonight!
Give me somethin' to break
Give me somethin' to break
Just give me somethin' to break
How 'bout your fuckin' face?
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw (What?)
A chainsaw (What?)
A motherfuckin' chainsaw (What?)
So come and get it
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the he says/she says bullshit
I think you better quit talkin' that shit, punk
So come and get it21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover
No one knows what it's like to be mistreated
To be defeated behind blue eyes
No one knows how to say that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not tellin' lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes29EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Check, one, one, two

I came into this world as a reject
Look into these eyes, then you'll see the size of the flames (Size of 'em!)
Dwellin' on the past, (Past!) it's burnin' on my brain (Hot!)
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain
Hey, I think about the day (Days!)
My girlie ran away with my pay when fellas came to (Play!) play
Now, she's stuck with my homies that she fucked (Ooh!)
And I'm just a sucker with a lump in my throat, hey

Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!)

Should I be feelin' bad? (No!) Should I be feelin' good? (No!)
It's kinda sad, I'm the laughin' stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that I'd be movin' on (Move it!)
But I'm a sucker, like I said, fucked up in the head, not!
And maybe, she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break, my heart'll ache either way
Hey, what the hell, what you want me to say?
I won't lie, that I can't deny
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)

So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…

Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (But you were!)
By my so-called girl, but in reality
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender heart in a blender, and still, I surrendered
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump

I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)

The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…

I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you, "Just let it go!"
It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
And nothing gonna change, you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)

"Mr. Durst?"
"Yeah?"
"We need your help. Pulling into the diner about now should be four top-secret agents. One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase."

All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one till I jet (I'ma be the one till I jet)
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Your money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

(Shhhhhh...)
Now I know why
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)

Now I know why you wanna hate me!
Now I know why you wanna hate me!
Now I know why you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

DJ Premier
Uh, uh, uh

Who could be the boss? Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin' up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path, runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
A lotta stamps and brands, we like a bar code
I'm bashin' all the media strikes to keep the media dykes
As reinforcement for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone, I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills that keep my total bills
Over a million the last time I checked it
Thank God, I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock 'em out

They call me Big John Studd, my middle name Mud
Dirty water flow, too much for you thug
They can't stand the flood – what up, doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd,  the sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn!)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn!)
Playin' wit' minds that get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club wit' this ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day, 'til they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood, can't feel me 'til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day, Father forgive us
They know not what they do, all praise is due
I'm big like E-Z and Big Bambu
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!

Headstrong, dead calm, Dead by Dawn
Dead weight, they dead wrong, let's get it on
Twelve rounds of throw down – who hold crown?
Protect land wit' four pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin' through your stereo, why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefes, tryin' to taste mine
Actin' like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the bassline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles
Where'd you find that monster? She beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit, roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, and then jet
Mic check, so what's it all about? And where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin' on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock, you gettin' one-shot
Until you dissolve, I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone, but don't you forget you're in a zone
So shut the fuck up, and take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's wack (Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Never even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu-Tang-Clan for the crown

What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
What's that? I didn't hear you
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, a little louder!
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody in together now
Shut the fuck up!
What, huh?
Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!
It was over your head – all day, every day
S.I.N.Y. 10304
Wu-Tang Killa Bees
And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T
Y'all know the time, y'all know the rhyme
It ain't easy bein' greazy in a world full of cleanliness
And, you know, all that other madness
We gone, peace!
Limp Bizkit, Method Man
Rock the house y'all! Bring it on!15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Play the fuckin' track!
Play that fuckin' track! Oh, there it is
Limp Bizkit! DMX! (What?!)
Redman! (That's right, y'all!) Method Man!
We just keep on rollin, baby!
Are you ready? Are you ready? ARE YOU READY?!

Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now (C'mon!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What?!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

Now I know y'all be lovin this shit right here
L-I-M-P, Bizkit is right here
People in the house, put them hands in the air
'Cause if you don't care, then we don't care! (Yeah)
See, I ain't givin' a fuck, quit pressin' your luck
Untouchable, branded unfuckable
So keep me in this cage until you run that mouth
Then I'mma have the plague and break the fuck out
And then we'll see who's left, after one round with X
And what am I bringin' next? Just know it's Red and Meth
So where the fuck you at, punk? Shut the fuck up!
And back the fuck up, while we fuck this track up!
Are you ready? Are you ready? ARE YOU READY?!

Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now (C'mon!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (What?!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' (Uh!)
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Oh what, y'all thought y'all wasn't gon' see me?

Check my dangerous slang atrocious
When I let these nuts hang, focus, it's Wu-Tang
What the fuck's a Hootie and the Blowfish?
I wave my Black Flag at the roaches
Who approaches, these twin, supersoakers
Who have poisonous darts for culprits
Too late to get your blow gun un-holstered
You're left buttered up and lightly toasted
So what, I drink and smoke too much
So what I cuss too much, shut the fuck up!
Now when we roll, you motherfuckers tuck in your gold
'Cause for the platinum, I'm jackin' niggas up in limos
It ain't nothin', for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description, yellow male, tissue up in his nose
You bitches, swing the vine on the baboon nuts
I'm hairy as hell, outta hell and tattooed up
I'm a dog only fuck in the bathroom, what?
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts

My name is Johnny, Donnie Brasco
Tuck the gat low, cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money, funny
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me
Docs and Hot Nix, bodies in the mosh pit

And I'm the D.O., you lookin' at the raw invented
On Friday, I spit 35 to 40 minutes
Smell up the bathroom like Craig paw was in it
Endin' up on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me, I crack 'em all to Guinness
Fuck how many thugs players and ballers in it
Brick City, Shaolin, better call us sinners
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it
AAAAAAAHHHHH!
C'mon!

Now move in, now move out, hands up or hands down
Back up, back up, tell me what ya gonna do now
Breathe in, now breathe out, hands up or hands down

Now I'm a fair nigga, but ain't nann nigga (Uh!)
Quicker than the hair-trigga, so if you dare nigga (Uh! C'mon!)
It'll be like your man tryin' to hold yo' brain to yo' head
But you'll be shittin' on yourself, 'cause you already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket (Uh!)
Leavin' just enough of him to stuff in a basket (Uh! Uh!)
A tisket a tasket, I really need my ass kicked (What?! What?!)
My moms never let me forget, that I'm a bastard (What?!)
I ain't never been shit, and ain't gon' be shit (Uh! Uh!)
That's why I take shit, whenever I see shit (Uh! Uh!)
It's just that D shit, D's short for do what I wanna do (C'mon!)
And that's what I'm gonna do, right here in front of you (Yeah! Yeah!)
And I'll be runnin you and your man straight up out (Uh!)
While y'all niggas ain't runnin' a fuckin' thing but yo' mouth (Woo!)

Because we get it on (When?), every day and every night (Oh)

So you better get some better beats and uh, get some better rhymes (Duh!)
You really, really, really wanna get shit started?
Well people everywhere, just get retarded
Get retarded, get retarded! People everywhere, just get retarded!

They say that rock-shit doesn't rock anymo'

Come on, back it's the motherfuckin' Rock-God
I'm so poker-faced, ladies goin' Ga-Ga
That's right, it's Freddy D, the public enemy
You know, the one to have Britney droppin' to her knees
I don't give a fuck, I probably never will
Bitch, get at me if that ass is like Jessica Biel's
Who down with me tonight? You know, I'll treat you right
You shake for me until they turnin' on them ugly lights
Throw them fingers up, and finger-fuck the sky
She like the way we pump it, I call her pumpkin pie
I ain't about to lie, I came up in it high
You got a problem? I'll bust you in your fucking eye (player!)
"Baby, you're a rockstar!", I know who the fuck I am
40 million records later, I am still the fuckin' man
I came to rock, all she wants to do is roll
Now she at my house slidin' up and down that pole

Ah, fuck the world, bust a nut
I'm on this and that, and such and such
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust, come on!
Rock! Rock, rock with a real nigga
Everything I touch turn to gold, she a gold digger
Shots! Shots, shots, have a lil' liquor
Got the bitch takin' shots like Reggie Miller
Uh, Lil Weezy in this bitch hoe
She want the green light –  let the bitch go
I go hard, I go nuts, I go schizo
And now they wanna copy me like ten-fo'
Uh, I can't stop, I won't stop
I got the pistol on me, I guess I went pop
Now I'm free-fallin', yeah, head first
Red hat to the back like Fred Durst

Lil Weezy, that's my patna, we drinkin' Russian vodka
'Bout to take your bitch 'cause she ain't never fucked a rockstar
I'm a fuckin' outlaw, packin' me a chainsaw
I'm at the afterparty, 'bout to start another brawl
I'm gettin' fucked up, so you can go to hell
I'ma need a ride home, I know myself
And you know I put it down like no one else
I'm the champ, bitch, I ain't gotta show the belt
