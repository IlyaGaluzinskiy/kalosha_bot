You should have seen it
You should have been there
You won't believe the shit we saw that went down in there
The men were women
The girls were fellas
They did a rain dance wearing nothing but umbrellas
Pass it on!

There was a lady
She had a sister
But it was kinda weird that way the lady kissed her
There were a woman
Whose name was Norman
And the frilly knickers
That was just the doorman
Pass it on!

There was a doorman
Whose name was Norman
And then the doorman kissed his sister

She's a Mormon
I heard there's dungeons
Inside the cellars
Where they rain down pain and spank you with umbrellas

And all the drag queens had to
Lip-sync cause they can't sing
Pass it on!

Girls which was confusing
Pass it on!

So what's a lip sync?
Is that like kissing?

Yeah he kissed a girl whose girly parts were missing

It was something he said
Something he said
His words built a wall
A wall inside my head
Just one little thing
Didn't mean that much to him
But it keeps building and building and building
This wall in my head
This wall in my head
Just one tiny thought
It started out so small
The thought made a brick
The bricks made a wall
And the wall keeps me down
And the wall trips me up
And it keeps building and building and building
This wall in my head
This wall in my head
And here I
Stand with me feet stuck to the floor
As I shout down the street
Screaming for more
Over the wall
Over the wall
I see my future standing tall
Over the wall
Over the wall
I can believe I'd have it all
So I keep climbing and climbing and climbing
This wall in my head, head, head
I'll keep on climbing and climbing and climbing
This wall in my head, head, head
This wall in my head
This wall in my head
It was something he said
Just one little thing
The thought left a scar
The words left a sting
Those words are the walls
That still hold me in
And they keep building and building and building and building
And don't fall, I'm finding me feet
There's shoes to be filled
But this wall is harder to beat
When it's one you helped build
Over the wall
Over the wall
I see my future standing tall
Over the wall
Over the wall
I can't believe I'd have it all
So I keep climbing and climbing and climbing
This wall in my head, head, head
I'll keep on climbing and climbing and climbing
This wall in my head, head, head
Oh, I'll keep climbing and climbing and climbing
And climbing and climbing and climbing
And climbing and climbing
And hand over hand over hand over brick over
Hand over brick over hand over, brick over
Climbing, climbing, climbing, climbing
This wall in my head
This wall in my head
This wall in my head
This wall in my head
 
It means something that's only yours to give
It means choosing the way you want to live
It means wonderful
And it means powerful
And it means true
It means something as perfect as it's pure
It means waiting until you know you're sure
It means beautiful
And it's beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
A little bit of glitter in the grey
Beautiful, beautiful
Something precious you don't simply give away
It means something that's always yours to keep
It's the face you don't take off to go to sleep
It means simple
And it means magical like a kiss
It's a path that you choose to walk upon
Not some fleeting thing you find one day is gone
It means innocence
And it means confidence like you
Beautiful, beautiful
A little bit of glitter in the grey
Beautiful, beautiful
Something precious you don't rush to give away
Beautiful, beautiful
A little bit of glitter in the grey
Beautiful, beautiful
Something precious you don't rush to give away
Beautiful
 
You belong in the spotlight
On the wall of the Tate
In a 10 megawatt light
'Cause your brushwork's so great
You're the next phase in feminine
You're a Lichtenstein dot
You're a bed with Tracy Emin in
You're Grayson Perry's next pot
Work of art, work of art

With a smile to melt your heart
Work of art, work of art
You're a perfect work of art
Like Picasso
So kick ass, oh

I tried to teach you a lesson, Jamie
I told you all your best chance at life was to keep things real
But there's always one who thinks I don't mean them
And surprise, surprise Jamie New, it's you!
The work of art
But a work of art is nothing if it's not put on show, Jamie

Come on, then
Put on a show!

The glamour!
The light!

The center of attention!

This is it, Jamie
I hope it's everything you ever wanted

This is everything I ever wanted
My stage, my audience, my dancers
All eyes on me
You wanna look? Keep looking
I'll be in drag tonight at Legs 11
So come along if you dare

You're just a boy in a dress!

Oh, Dean
A boy in a dress is something to be laughed at
But a drag queen is something to be feared
And I am a drag queen!

Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are, oh
You're the biz, you're the biz, you're the biz, yeah
Superstar, superstar, superstar, oh

Work of art, work of art

Gonna blow your world apart
I'm offending, I'm a trending, gender-bending
Gender-blending, gender-pending
Gender-ending and transcending
Work of art
 
'Cause the party's just starting
And you don't want to miss it
The party's just starting
Almost so close you can kiss it
Don't wait for tomorrow
Be happy today
And all of those stupid people
Who cares what they say
I know it's not easy
But I know you're strong
And I know that somewhere
They're playing your song
Out of the darkness
Into the spotlight
Everyone's waiting, Jamie
In the place where you belong
And somewhere's a party
That can't start without you
And somewhere the DJ
Is playing your song

When the curtain's going up
All eyes on me
When the lights are going down
All eyes on me
When the crowds are showing up
All eyes on me
Cause the lights are going down
All eyes on me

Hey, can you hear them?
That's your audience awaiting
There'll be cues 'round the theater
For all the shows you're creating
And maybe they'll be curtains
Hung in velvet maroon
And maybe there'll be ice cream
In a tiny tub with a built-in spoon
Out of the darkness, into the spotlight
Everyone's waiting, Jamie
'Cause that's where you belong
Somewhere's a party
That can't start without you
Somewhere the DJ
Is playing your song
Is playing your song
'Cause the party's just starting
 
The cold empty mornings
The coffee cup warnings
Remembering the spark
That lived in a love
That died in the dark
But life keeps you guessing
Along came a blessing
My world was awake
My precious surprise
My perfect mistake
And maybe he'll break my heart
'Cause he'll take my heart when he goes
I'm dreading the day when he just walks away
He's my boy
He drives me insane
He's my boy
My pleasure, my pain
He's my boy
Believe me, he don't make it easy
He'd own me until he's outgrown me
But still, he's my boy
He's my boy
From the moment I saw him
No man came before him
He taught me to fight
To knock back the black
To let in the light
And maybe he'll break my heart
'Cause he'll take my heart
When he goes
It's cruel that he can but that's just like a man
He's my boy
My blessing, my curse
He's my boy
For better, for worse
He's my boy
Believe me, he don't make it easy
He needs me, fulfills me
Then bleeds me but still, he's my boy
He's my boy
And don't tell me I'm fooling myself
Fooling again
'Cause I know the path
I know the price
And I know the man
And I know the bright lights are going to tend him to stray
But I'll trade my tomorrows
To have him today
Today
Today
He's my-
He's my-
He's my-
He's my boy
And boys always grow
He's my boy
And boys always go
He's my boy
He's blinded and so floating minded
He's clueless and clever
Confusing, whatever
But oh boy
He's my voice
He's my chance
He's my smile
He's my day
He's my life
He's my pain
He's my joy
He's my baby
He's my man
He's my boy
 
There's a place where I belong
There's a place where I belong
For the kid who came out wrong
There's a place where I belong
Far from your father's eyes
Lost in your mother's lies
Ugly in this ugly world is all I am
Why am I even here?
Can't I just disappear?
'Cause ugly is the only thing that's true now
And ugly poisons everything I do now
And shit and shame and ugliness is who I am
I am
Ugly is an ugly face and
Ugly is an ugly kid
Ugly is this ugly place where
Ugly does what ugly did
Ugly in this ugly world is all I am
All I am
 
There's a clock on the wall and it's moving too slow
It's got hours to kill and a lifetime to go
And I'm holding my breath 'til I hear the last bell
Then I'm coming out hard and I'm giving 'em hell
I'm a superstar and you don't even know it
In a wonder bra and you don't even know it

Your boring nights, your dull cliches
Get off and hit the track

You're in my lane, you're in my light
Get out my way - I'm taking flight
And I ain't coming back

And I'm gonna kiss the sun!

And if ever you find life is getting you down
Well, there's a party to start in a new part of town
Where there's a guest list of one and the name's Jamie New

Once in a lifetime
There will rise a hero
Who's approaching footsteps
Will cause the earth to quake
Once in a lifetime
They'll baptize a hero
In the blood she left in her wake
The legend of Loco Chanelle
I'll sing a story now of way out West
Of Madame Loco and the blood red dress
And of the man who didn't treat her right
You see that dress, well it started out white
She was the sweetest thing you'd ever seen
Raised on a cattle ranch in Southey Green
She was a beauty queen in '79
And spent her summers on the Greyhound line
But she knew that every queen must have a crown
So she set off to a place called London Town
Where streets are paved with gold and lit with dreams
And magpies come to gather all that gleams
A simple girl, she never traveled far
But in her heart there burned a superstar
She'd hit 'em hard and swore she'd give 'em hell
The legend of

Loco Chanelle
She'd not a single friend to count upon
Until in Camden met a man named John
He liked her lipstick and he loved her wig
He told her

Babydoll I'll make you big
Stick with me kiddo and the city's yours
The fame, the fortune, the perpetual applause

She trusted Johny, so she spent the night
Who knew a wolf had such a charming bite?
But Johny was an agent, not a gent
And took more than the usual 10 percent
And though he promised Miss Chanelle the Earth
She soon discovered what his word was worth
On opening night the audience was packed
When she caught him screwing with a younger act
In flagrante at the Finchley Hotel
The tragedy of Loco Chanelle
The seats were sold out to the last reserves
She said: "I need a drink to calm my nerves"
Then she saw Johny with his tie askew
Her look was loaded and her gun was too
"Here's to you Johny, have a shot to start"
And then she smiled and shot him through the heart
Her dress was purest white till Johny bled
And turned her virgin gown to deepest red
She strolled onto the stage, a crimson queen
And killed the crowd by stealing every scene
And soon her fans were queuing round the block
To see the diva in the blood red frock
And that, my dear, is how the star shall rise
With ruby lips and murder in her eyes
Till one day to avoid a prison cell
Miss Loco vanished like a magic spell
Where she is now, no! I'll never tell
That's the legend of Loco Chanelle
 
Well you've come pretty far
But you know where you are
You're home
And the friends that you choose
Want to walk in your shoes
You're home
Any time you feel your skies are falling
Look above see a bright silver lining
Listen up at your own freedom calling
Calling you to a day where you're shining

Out of the darkness
Into the spotlight
There is a new star
Shining so bright
Out of the darkness
Into the spotlight
There is a new star
Shining so bright
In this place where we belong
In this place where we belong

So get up when you're down
'Cause this homecoming crown has come home
I was lost, I was found
Took the long way around
But I'm home
You and me got a song that we're singing
You and me got a drum that we're drumming
Listen up to the changes we're ringing
Nothing's gonna stop us from coming

Out of the darkness
Into the spotlight
There is a new star
Shining so bright
Out of the darkness
Into the spotlight
There is a new star
Shining so bright

Every day's a chance
Every day's a choice
Even losers sometimes end up winning
So go and find your dance
Go and find your voice
'Cause the party's only just beginning

There's  a place where we belong
There's a place where we belong
And you'll hear us sing our song
In this place where we belong
Out of the darkness
Into the spotlight
There is a new star
Shining so bright
Out of the darkness
Into the spotlight
Follow your freedom
It's gonna be alright
In this place where we belong
In this place where we belong
In this place where we belong
In this place where we belong
