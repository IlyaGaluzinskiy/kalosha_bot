Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me
Life's gotta always be messin' with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feelin' like a freak on a leash (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free
Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
I'll rape your mind and now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
And fuck, your own child!
I scream, no one hears me!
It hurt, I'm not a liar!
My God, saw you watch!
Mommy, why your own child?

Little child, looking so pretty

Tied down, no one hit me!
And raped your own child!
I'm sick, no one hears me!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, "that's a good boy"!
You fucked your own child!
I speak, no one hears me!
It hurt, as a child!
Tied down, no one hears me!
Mommy why your own child?
I didn't touch you there!
Mommy said she didn't care!
I didn't touch you there!
That's why mommy stopped and stared!

Little child, looking so sweet
I rape your mind, and now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty!

Hey, I'm feeling tired
My time has gone today
You flirt with suicide
Sometimes that's okay
Do what others say
I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Day is here fading
That's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide
Sometimes kill the pain
I can't always say
"It's gonna be better tomorrow"
Falling away from me
Falling away from me

Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
It's lost and can't be found
Falling away from me
It's spinning round and round
Falling away from me
Throw it down

Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!

Twisting me!
They won't go away!
So I pray!
Go away!
Life's falling away from me
It's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me
Fuck!
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Beating me down!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!
Screaming some sound!
Beating me, beating me
Down, down
Into the ground!22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Another place I find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind
Deeper, and deeper, and deeper
As I journey to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner...
Self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (I can see I'm going)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind (going blind)
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
I'm blind!13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
Your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain

I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in…

I can't hear this (scat singing)
I can't fuck it (scat singing)
I can't take this (scat singing)
I hate (scat singing)
Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in…
Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kick off the front floor
Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real, I'll never ever follow
Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on
Hate, something, someway, each day
Dealing with no forgiveness
Why, this shit inside, now everyone will follow
So give me nothing just feel and now this shit will follow

God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something they took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see so come dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Me!
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!

Keep holding on
When my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts
Have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along, mockingbird
You don't affect me
That's right!
Deliverance of my heart!
Please strike!
Be deliberate!

Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!

Choke, choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I tasted sorrow on my tongue
And the sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me
That's right!
Trigger between my eyes!
Please strike!
Make it quick now!
Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!

I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong so, delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
HIV!

Here I am different in this normal world
Why did you tease me, made me feel upset?
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly, please just go away

HIV!
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
HIV!
Why you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay

As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably, you'd just throw me away

I can see it's hard to find
HIV!
This blessing in disguise
Why you treat me this way?
HIV!
Made the hate stay
Faget!
Faget!

You'll see

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day son
You fake, if we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way every day
Who gives a fuck, right now I got something to say
To all the people that think I'm strange
And I should be out here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty boy feeling like I'm enslaved
To the world that never appreciated shit
You can suck my dick and fucking like it!
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world
I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?
All my life, who am I?

You little faggot ho', please give me some shit to work with
Cause right now I'm all it, kid, suck my dick, kid, like your daddy did
Who the fuck you think you're talking to? (Me!)
I'm known for eating little whiny chumps like you (Whatever)
All up in my face with that "are you ready?"
But halitosis is all you're rocking steady
You little fairy, smelling on your flowers
Nappy hairy chest, look it's Austin Powers (Aw, yeah, baby!)
I hear ya tweeting on them fag-pipes, clod
But you said it best, there's no place to hide

What the fuck ya saying? You're a pimp whatever, Limp dick
Fred Durst needs to rehearse, needs to reverse what he's saying

(Say what, say what?
You better watch your fucking mouth, Jon)

Throwing rhymes at me like, oh shit, alright, Vanilla Ice

Bisc Limpkit, at least I got a P.H.A.T. original band

Who's hot, who's not? (You!)
You best step back, Korn on the cob (Okay)
You need a new job (Ha!)
Time to take them mic skills back to the dentist and buy yourself a new grill (Fuck you!)
You pumpkin pie, I'll jack off in your eye
Climbing shoots and ladders, while your ego shatters
But you just can't get away
Because it's doomsday kid, it's doomsday

You're more like Jerry Springer (Oh, cool!)
Your favorite band is Winger (Winger?)
And all you eat is Zingers
You're like a Fruity Pebble
Your favorite flag is rebel (Yee-haw!)
It's just too bad that you're a fag
And on a lower level

So you're from Jacksonville, kicking it like Buffalo Bill
Getting butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck
While your sister's on her knees
Waiting for your little peanut

Wait, where'd you get that little dance? (Over here!)
Like them idiots in Waco, you're burning up in Bako
Where your father had your mother, your mother had your brother (Nuh-uh!)
It's just too bad your father's mad, your mother's now your lover

Come on hillbilly, can your horse do a fucking wheelie?
You love it down south and boy, you sure do got a purdy mouth

Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you, too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on, you twisted transistor
Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your breasts, your dress
Vibrations coming through
You're in a mess

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you, too

Music do!

Music do!
Music do!
Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt!
Says who? Says who?
Anesthetize this bitch
Anesthetize this bitch
Anesthetize
Just let me be
Between you and me
Don't Fit

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you, too

Hang on, you twisted transistor8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
