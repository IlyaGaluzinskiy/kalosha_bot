When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

Good morning!
Yeaaaaaah!
One, two... one, two, three, four!
Pump it up!
Aaaah!

I ramp, me no ramp, me no skin
Me no play, yeah
When me chant 'pon the microphone
And me say with the DJ
Junglists in the place
Junglists on the case
Scooter, are you Ratty?

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me (Yeah!)
When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me (Come on!)
Love, peace and unity
Siberia, the place to be
The K, the L, the F and the -ology
Hallelujah!

One, two... one, two, three, yeah!
Rough!
Aah!
Here we go!
Yeah

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

Stand up!
Once again!
We're gettin' jiggy!
Siberiaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Yay!
Goodbye!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don't give a penny
Fuck 2020!

Posse, united we stand
First we save the rave
Then we save the world
Ah, we got the power!
Ahaha
A nightmare came true
The worst year ever
Like everyone's insane
Insane in the membrane

We're runnin' 'til we can't no more, no obstacle
Can hold us back, you know we're unstoppable
It's not impossible, we strive for more
Keep runnin' 'cause we know we're unstoppable
We're runnin' 'til we can't no more, no obstacle
Can hold us back, you know we're unstoppable
It's not impossible, we strive for more
Keep runnin' 'cause we know we're unstoppable
Here we come
Yes

We won't ever stop
The next tune we drop
We don't give a penny
Fuck 2020!


We're runnin' 'til we can't no more, no obstacle
Can hold us back, you know we're unstoppable
It's not impossible, we strive for more
Keep runnin' 'cause we know we're unstoppable

Yeah!

We're runnin' 'til we can't no more, feeling like fools
Hold us back, you know we're unstoppable
It's not impossible, I hate all the rules
Runnin' 'cause we know we're unstoppable
We won't ever stop
The next tune we drop
We don't give a penny
Fuck 2020!
Fuck 2020!

Stuck on the wrong channel
Like chained to a dead camel, ahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Girl of my dreams
You don't know what means
To live my life without you
I hope everyday
When you pass my way
I there to say a word to you
But everytime you look at me
I go right out of my head
And then I just turn away
And act like I don't see you
You're so far away
No reason to stay here
I live in silence
Sometimes I think
I'll win back my confidence
And be the man I used to be
But a touch of your smile
And I feel so strange again
And lose myself in the wait and see
And everytime when you are near
And act like you don't care I get so insecure
And then I'm not so sure
You're so far away
No reason to stay here
I live in silence
You're so far away
No reason to stay here
I live in silence, leave in silence...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Always lived my life alone
Been searching for a place called home
I know that I've been cold as ice
Ignored the dreams, too many lies
