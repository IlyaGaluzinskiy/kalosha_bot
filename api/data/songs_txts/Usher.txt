Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's go!

I was up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a lil' V-I
Keep it down on the low-key (Low-key)
'Cause you know how it feels (Hey!)
I seen shoawty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me (Know me)
I decided to chill (Okay!)
Conversation got heavy (Hey!)
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (Watch out!)
Ohh! (Watch out)
She's saying, "Come get me" (Come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, "Baby, let's go"
When I told her (Let's go!), I said

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

So she's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now) (Let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (Hey!)
'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead?
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
(Let's go, bring the beat back!) And I say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
(Hey! Hey! Luda!)

Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club, looking so conspicuous
And *"roar!"*, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)
I won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front, and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (Yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say

(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shawty got down low, she said, "come and get me"
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!

Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go (Clap)
Take that, rewind it back

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn
 
Yeah
Ursher, baby
This is for the A

If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho

Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind

The ballers in here tonight, they gon’ buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch

I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind
When you work until three, if you’re leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money

Watch this

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions

Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, "One second, baby, please hear me"

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies say: "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad


You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...
 
She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing

So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven

Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals

'Cause I don't need no more rivals

I'ma love ya till my time's gone
You gotta give me dirty love

I've been here and trust me, I've seen it all before though
I told my ex for me relationships a no-no
And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo
You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo'
I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place
I know you wanna settle down, all on your face
Feeling starting to get too familiar
So cover up this broken love treason

Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals

You say I see ya side by side
Like a visionary, I can't see me falling
(Nothing's changed)
Like a dictionary, I can't read through all this
(Eyes wide open)
I still fall blind I don't know how this will end
Let's go back to the beginning
Let's cover up this broken love treason

Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals

I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that...

Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called, I told you, "Baby, I'm working"
(No!) I was out doing my dirt
(Oh!) Wasn't thinking 'bout you getting hurt
(I) was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center like, man
Not giving a damn who sees me
So gone, so wrong
Acting like I didn't have you sitting at home
Thinking about me
Being the good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else

Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Wooooooaaaah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long (Yeah)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Yeah yeah)
And I want you to know that
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Ooh ooh yeah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad (All bad)
And I just wanna confess (Yeah yeah)
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (So wrong)
And I want you to know that...

If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over, I would
Instead of everything being all bad, baby, everything'll be all good
I don't wanna lose you
But I know what I'm telling you ain't gon' make you wanna stay
You probably just wanna run away
I'm mad enough to punch me in my face
I've been living like an idiot and I deserve every bit of it
I know today is the day that I end all the lying and the playing and the bullshit, girl
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry
But I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest
I confesssssss...

Everything that I've been doing is all bad (Everything)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Wooooooaaaah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Too wrong)
And I want you to know that (Want you to know)
Everything that I've been doing is all bad (All bad)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess (Ooh ooh ooh)
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that...

Stevie, break it down
Oh oh, oh oh
Dear baby
Oh, baby
Don't leave me, baby


(Everything that I've)
Everything that (been doing) I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just (it's all bad) wanna confess
It's been going on so long (Going on so long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Doing you so wrong)
And I want you to know that
Everything (all bad, all bad) that I've been doing is all bad (All bad)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Ah baby yeeaah)
I've been telling you so many lies (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't none good, it's all bad (Oh baby)
And I just wanna confess (Oh baby)
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Oh, no baby)
And I want you to know that (So bad, so bad)
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad...
