(RyanKhan) Verses:
You know you got Khan on the track
(fuck)
So this gotta be bloody
I see blood on my hands
Guess it’s the pen and the paper
I staple it to you head, like the pin in the paper
Coming heavy like Schwarzenegger
Destroying all you rappers like I’m a terminator
With this pen I feel like I’m a gladiator
Eating you haters, like I’m a man-eater
They say that I’m a perpetrator
But I’ve been betrayed, since 5th Grade
By a lot of traitors( betrayed), said that in TRIP
Bars so dynamic, like sex in a exquisite relationship(fuck satisfactory)
Say that I’m a hypocrite, NAH NAH
Just opposite towards people who are toxic
And benefit from it
The only thing I’ve got on my bucket list
Is to bust these fake faggots by this rap shit
I’m just trapped in it,  drowned in the guilt
The devil won’t permit me to come out of it (it won’t)
And tells me to quit and not to spit
Why?
Cause these crony rappers tell me that I don’t fit
(fuckno)
Who just write this shit, for the heck of it
Well I’m committed to this rap shit
Like a pilot to his cockpit
Say my lyrics are explicit
Motherfuckers are just not open minded
But when it comes to their own
They are just kind hearted
Doesn’t matter to me since I fucking bogarted
And yeah
Anh this is how it goes right
Ryan This, Ryan That
Ryan Here, Ryan There
Ryan Every fucking Where
I just said Ryan, I had to say Rayaan
Cause they say that my accent is fake
Fuck, can’t take any of it anymore
(won’t)
I didn’t land into this game by an accident bro
(didn’t)
I’m here to stay bro
( I am)
So why you act like an idiotic bitch bro
(Why?)
You tell me that I snitch bro
( I don’t)
Stop acting like a dick bro
(Fucking stop)
Yeah
*Language Change*(Urdu)
Yeh saarey mere, mere pai paltay
(Paltay)
Yeh ruswa karke, mujse gillay karte
(Karte)
Ye gillay karke, mujse firbi jaltay
(Jaltay)
Raaste khulke, mere raaste kat tay
(Kat tay)
Ye Raas nahi aaye, toh ye raaz nahi rakhtay
(Nahi)
Raaz nahi rakh kay, ye toh baatai kartay
(baatay kartay)
Baatay karke kehte, baat nahi kartay
( hah)
Jo kehte, hum tere liye martay
Whoh tere girnay ka intazar hai kartay
(Hah, Intazaar, Girne Ka Intazaar)
Usko kho kay maine khudko paaya
Khudko paakay, maine usko khoya
*Urdu Part Translation*:
My own turned against me
Left me alone, and then tried to act like victims
Even while acting like victims, they got jealous
As my life goes smooth, all the doors open
Suddenly something bad happens, and all those doors close
You say or do something, and if it goes against their wish, they will spill all your secrets
As they spill all your secrets, they will trash talk too
As they trash talk, and you confront them
They will not own up to it, and deny it
The ones, who tell they will die for you
Are the ones, who are waiting for your fall
As I lost her, I found myself
As I found myself, my worth, I lost herEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
